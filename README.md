Added on to original and added some personal functions

Script to extract urls from files found in discord cache and to download the urls if you want to:

Should work on linux and MacOS -- it most likely will not work on your computer unless you have a similar filesytem but feel free to edit it as you want. You will see the directory structure in bashOS.py.
Depending on your OS the bash os.system commands might differ and not work, so make sure that bashOS.py is compatible with your OS:

# How to use
```cd Desktop```
```git clone```

Choose what you want to filter your cache to and edit accordingly in urlext.py:

Change ```urmom``` to the username on your computer that you see in your directory structure:
