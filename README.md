# DiscordCacheUrlsExtract
Added on to original and added some personal functions

Script to extract urls from files found in discord cache

clears the cache

made to use personally on linux with linking it my own tools by using os.system(command)-- it most likely will not work on your computer unless you have a similar filesytem and if you haven't made the nessesary directories.

sudo python3 urlext.py

use at own risk

# Why this and not a file converter?

Discord has lots of malware exploits designed for the discord cache

Storing the images as a link is safer than converting them
But you can do this by editing https://github.com/beans816/request-bash
